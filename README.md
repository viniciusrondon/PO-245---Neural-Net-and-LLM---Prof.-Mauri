# Repository for PO_249: Neural Networks and Large Language Models

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive archive for materials, assignments, and solutions related to the course PO_249 - Neural Networks and Large Language Models, instructed by Professor Mauri, as part of my Master's degree program at the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA). The primary objective of this project is to systematically address and document the tests, assignments, and practical exercises encountered during the semester. This repository will be continually updated to reflect progress and incorporate new content as the course unfolds.

## Project Structure and Contents

The repository is organized into various files and directories, each serving a specific purpose. Below is a detailed overview of the key components:

### Jupyter Notebooks
- **01.setup.ipynb**: This notebook facilitates the initial setup of the project environment by creating essential directories such as 'data', 'image', 'utils', and 'paper'. It ensures that the necessary folder structure is in place for organizing project resources.
- **02.list_01.ipynb**: This notebook addresses the first assignment (Lista 01), focusing on the application of the steepest descent optimization algorithm to the function \( f(x, y) = x y e^{-(x^2 + y^2)} \). It includes step-by-step calculations, gradient computations, Python implementations for iterative optimization, and visualizations using Plotly to illustrate the function, gradient directions, and descent paths.

### Python Scripts
- **main.py**: The primary Python script for the project, intended to serve as an entry point for running key functionalities or experiments (further details will be added as the project evolves).

### Configuration Files
- **pyproject.toml**: A configuration file for managing project dependencies, likely utilizing tools such as Poetry or similar for reproducible environments.
- **uv.lock**: A lock file that records exact versions of dependencies, ensuring consistency across different setups.

### Directories
- **Aulas**: Contains lecture notes, slides, or materials from class sessions, providing foundational knowledge on neural networks and large language models.
- **data**: Stores datasets required for assignments, experiments, or analyses.
- **image**: Holds images, figures, or visual aids used in notebooks or documentation.
- **list**: Dedicated to assignment-related files, such as problem sets or solution drafts.
- **paper**: Archives research papers, articles, or references pertinent to the course topics.
- **exam**: Includes tests, exams, or evaluation materials from the course.
- **utils**: Contains utility scripts, helper functions, or reusable code modules to support the main project tasks.

## Usage Instructions

To begin working with this repository:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install any required dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`.
3. Execute the `01.setup.ipynb` notebook to initialize the directory structure.
4. Explore the notebooks and scripts for specific assignments or topics.

For optimal performance, it is recommended to use a Python environment with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Plotly installed.

## Updates and Contributions

This repository will be regularly updated with new assignments, solutions, and resources as the course progresses. Should you have any suggestions or contributions, please feel free to contact me. Your feedback is greatly appreciated in enhancing the quality and utility of this academic resource.

Thank you for your interest in this project.
